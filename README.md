# Project_A4

I plan to make a choice game, similar to the last big project I did that used buttons where it leads you to multiple paths based on what choice you made

This might also include an animation based on that choice you made
 This can be done by using images and animation packs from salmon cookies

 This entire repository is gonna be an improvement on my previous project

 The texts and buttons delay includes arrays with the use of setTimeout

 Another thing I wanna add is a timer, when the timer runs out, it forces you into another webpage
